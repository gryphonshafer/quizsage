# Material Labels and Descriptions

QuizSage supports use of material *labels* and/or material *descriptions* to define the material used and how verses are selected in features like quiz (pick-up or meet), queries drill, initial memorization, and reference tools. Descriptions are required and defined by the [CBQ rule book](https://cbqz.org/rules). Labels are more expressive and therefore more complex than descriptions, though usually shorter and easier to read at a glance. All descriptions are labels, but not all labels are descriptions.

## Most Common Simple Uses

In most cases, a minimum viable description will contain a single reference range followed by a Bible translation acronym. For example:

> Ephesians 6 NIV

When queries need to be generated (like when using the drills of quiz tools), reference ranges must include multiple chapters. This can be done by simply expanding the range. For example:

> Ephesians 5-6 NIV

But in cases where you only want queries in the drill or quiz to be sourced from a single chapter, you’ll need to use a zero-weight component. For example:

> Ephesians 6 (1) Ephesians (0) NIV

## Description Components

Let’s start off by examining the components of descriptions. Valid descriptions must contain at least 1 reference range and optionally any additional description components.

### Reference Ranges

A *reference range* is an expression that identifies 1 or more Bible verses, including book name and optionally chapters and verses. If verse numbers are included, they must follow a chapter number and a colon. For example:

- John 3:16
- Romans 3
- Mark

Multiple verses or chapters can be listed explicitly, separated by commas, or in a range, separated by a dash. For example:

- Ephesians 6:10, 12, 18
- Ephesians 6:10-18
- Ephesians 3, 5-6

Multiple ranges can be appended together. For example:

> Galatians 1:11-2:10; 4:8-20; Ephesians 6:10-18

It’s not necessary to write out the full and exact book name. Anything that can be recognized as a valid book name will likely work. For example, all the following are valid:

- Genesis, Gen, Ge, Gn
- Exodus, Ex, Exo
- 2 Corithians, II Corithians, 2 Cor, 2Co

Any recognized book acronym will be replaced by the full, canonical book name.

### Range Weights

A reference range can be suffixed with a weight, a number in parentheses, which identifies the probability the preceding reference range is used when generating each query. Consider the following:

> Ephesians 1-3 (1) Ephesians 4 (3)

When generating a query with the above material description, chapter 4 will be selected 75% of the time, and chapters 1 through 3 will be selected 25% of the time. Note that is on a per query basis; so if you generate 100 queries, about 75 will be from chapter 4, but it’s not necessarily going to be exactly 75.

Any weights will be simplified to a lowest common denominator, with any non-digits ignored; so writing “Ephesians 1-3 (25%) Ephesians 4 (75%)” would result in the above example.

### Bible Translation Acronyms

A description requires at least 1 primary Bible translation acronym. Bible translations can be set as *primary* or *auxiliary*. Both primary and auxiliary translations have their content included in the materials QuizSage uses for the subsequent tool or action; however, if queries are generated, queries will only be constructed from primary translations. Auxiliary translation acronyms are noted by a trailing asterisk. In the following example, the current ESV and NIV translations are primary and the 1984a NIV translation is auxiliary:

> Ephesians 5-6 ESV NIV NIV84*

In all cases where QuizSage can accept a label/description, there will be a “Supported Bibles” reference list.

## Label Components

As previously mentioned, labels are like descriptions but with greater expressiveness. They’re basically just descriptions with additional supported components. This makes them usually shorter and easier to read at a glance. All descriptions are labels, but not all labels are descriptions.

### Aliases (or Saved Labels)

A label *alias* is a label saved in QuizSage under a name. For example, assume the following is a saved alias name and label:

- *Alias:* Pure Joy
- *Label:* James 1:2-8

When constructing a new label, one could specify the following:

> James 1:19-21; Pure Joy

Aliases can contain aliases. For example, you could save the following alias:

- *Alias:* James 1 Parts
- *Label:* James 1:19-21; Pure Joy

Then a new label could be constructed as follows:

> James 2; James 1 Parts

This new label would be equivalent to the following description:

> James 1:2-8, 19-21; 2

In all cases where QuizSage can accept a label/description, there will be an “Available Labels” reference list.

### Filter

A *filter* is a component that will be used to remove verses from a preceding set of label components. Filters start with a pipe character (i.e. “|”) followed by certain label components. For example, consider:

> Rom 1-3; Jam 1:2-8 | Rom 2-6

The filter here removes Romans chapters 2 through 6 from the preceding reference range. Romans chapters 1 through 3 are in the preceding reference range, so chapters 2 and 3 are removed. Thus, the above is equivalent to the following description:

> Romans 1; James 1:2-8

### Intersection

An *intersection* is similar to a filter, but where a filter removes from the preceding set of label components, an intersection results in the verses that exist within both the preceding and following label components. Filters start with a tilde character (i.e. “~”) followed by certain label components. For example, consider:

> Rom 1-3; Jam 1:2-8 ~ Rom 2-6

The above is equivalent to the following description:

> Romans 2-3

A common use case is combining an intersection with an alias representing a club list. For example, consider:

> 1 Cor 1-7 ~ Cor Club 100

This would result in a description for the Corinthians Club 100 verses for chapters 1 through 7.

### Addition (or Add Verses)

An *addition* allows for adding a certain number of subsequent verses to a preceded set of label components. An addition starts with a plus character (i.e. “+”) followed by an integer. For example, consider:

> Cor Club 100 +1

This will add the following verse to each of the Corinthians “Club 100” verses

### Blocks and Nesting

A *block* is a set of label components that should be interpreted in isolation to surrounding label components before being integrated with surrounding label components. Think of blocks like a parentheses in mathematics. Blocks are noted by square brackets. For example, consider:

> 1 Cor 1:1, 3, 5, 7 \[ Cor Club 100 +1 ]

In the above, the “+1” addition applies to only the Corinthians “Club 100” verses, not to the 4 verses from 1 Corinthians 1. Consider also the following label:

> Rom 1-5 \[ Rom 6-10 | Rom 9 ] Rom 11

The above is equivalent to the following description:

> Romans 1-8; 10-11

Note that aliases are functionally equivalent to blocks in terms of nesting precedence.

### Distributive

A *distributive* is a special type of label component that distributes a subsequent set of weighted components into a preceding set of weighted components via intersection. A distributive is denoted by a slash character (i.e. “/”) between the 2 sets of weighted components.

The most common use case for this is when you want a quiz to include weighted club lists (each saved as aliases) to be used as intersections for a weighted split of new versus old material. For example, consider:

> Romans 1-5 (1) Romans 6-7 (1) / Rom Club 100 (1) Rom Club 300 (2) All (3)

The “Rom Club 100” and “Rom Club 300” are aliases. The “All” term is a special alias that refers to all the weighted components that precede the distributive slash. Thus, the above example is functionally equivalent to the following:

> \[ Romans 1-5 ~ Rom Club 100 ] (1)<br>
> \[ Romans 6-7 ~ Rom Club 100 ] (1)<br>
> \[ Romans 1-5 ~ Rom Club 300 ] (2)<br>
> \[ Romans 6-7 ~ Rom Club 300 ] (2)<br>
> Romans 1-5 (3)<br>
> Romans 6-7 (3)

## Canonicalization and/or Descriptionization

When QuizSage encounters a label, it may cause that label to go through *canonicalization* and/or *descriptionization*.

Canonicalization includes but is not limited to:

- Parsing the label
- Confirming it and all its components are valid
- Changing all book names and alias names to their precise and full names
- Sorting reference ranges in a given scope first and merging them
- Sorting aliases in a given scope behind any reference ranges
- Merging any filters, intersections, and/or additions in a given scope
- Determining the lowest/simplest weights if any weights are used
- Organizing Bible translations alphabetically grouped by primary then auxiliary
- Removing any unnecessary blocks and/or weights

Descriptionization is the conversion of a label into a description.
