                This endpoint requires the same email address and password for
                an active application/API user. *User accounts can be created on
                the web site when not logged in. User accounts can be edited on
                the web site when logged in.*

                If authenticated when this endpoint is used, the API will set a
                cookie containing the login session (as would the application
                if the user logged in from the web site). The session cookie
                name is `quizsage_session`.

                Login via the web application or from the API results in the
                same cookie change.

                This endpoint removes the session cookie `quizsage_session`,
                resulting in a user logout condition.
