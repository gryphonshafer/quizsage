        This is the [QuizSage](https://quizsage.org)
        [OpenAPI](https://openapis.org) web service.

        This API is provided for free use by any QuizSage user. Please respect
        the API, service, servers, and networks by throttling heavy and/or
        repeated requests. **API abuse will be reported and associated user
        accounts may be deactivated.**

        Note that nearly all endpoints require authentication. Use the
        `/user/login` endpoint to login (or login via the web application, then
        return here).

        Limited technical support available. Use at your own risk. Please
        [report all defects and feature requests](https://github.com/gryphonshafer/quizsage/issues).

        Also note that while you can use the API to pull down all historical
        quizzing data and/or all material content, it's probably going to be
        substantially faster and easier for you to just
        [download the whole databases](/download) and work with them offline.
