        This is the [QuizSage](https://quizsage.org)
        [OpenAPI](https://openapis.org) web service.

        This API is provided for open and free use by any QuizSage user. Most
        requests require authentication with QuizSage user credentials. Please
        respect the API, service, servers, and networks by throttling heavy
        and/or repeated requests. **API abuse will be reported and associated
        user accounts may be deactivated.**

        Limited technical support available. Use at your own risk. Please report
        all defects and feature requests.

        Note that nearly all endpoints require authentication. Use the
        `/user/login` endpoint to login (or login via the web application, then
        return here).
