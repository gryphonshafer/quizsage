descriptionalization and canonicalization
    references are biblically sorted (internally), simplified, with full book names
    weights simplified
    weight blocks are sorted by reference
    bibles at the end and sorted primary before auxiliary then alphabetically; must have at least 1 primary
    multiple filters and intersections in the same context are merged (with filters in front of intersections)
    anything in a description, alias, or label that isn't understood is ignored/removed
    everything preceding a weight (up to either another weight or a distributive) is an implicit block

descriptionalization
    everything not a reference, weight, or bible converted down to these elements

canonicalization
    remove filters and intersections that don't cause changes
    unnecessary blocks are removed
        don't have weights or have only a single weight internally
        don't have a filter, intersection, distributive, or addition internally
