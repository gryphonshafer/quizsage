    <p>
        This page allows an application administrator to modify the system-wide
        thesaurus. Note that actions taken on this page are conducted
        universally. <b>Be sure you know what you're doing before you use this
        page.</b> Changes to the thesaurus should be done with great care and
        only after deep consideration for the impact those changes will make
        across the whole of the system for generations.
        <span class="warning">
            Do not make changes flippantly or to satisy the opinions of those
            who have not invested the significant forethougth into the
            multi-order-effects a change would create.
        </span>
        If you modify the thesaurus, <b>you and you <i>alone</i></b> will become
        the sole authority responsible for the change's derived outcomes.
    </p>

    <p>
        To modify the thesaurus, you need to enter and submit YAML for each
        entry you want to add, alter, or remove. The YAML needs to be an array
        of hashs. Each hash should describe the end-state of a given word.
        A regular, full entry will have <code>text</code> (the word) and
        <code>meanings</code> (a data structure representing the synonyms of
        each meaning of the word):
    </p>
    <pre>
- text: see
  meanings:
  - word: perceive with eyes
    type: verb
    synonyms:
    - verity: 3
      words:
      - look
      - notice
      - view
    - verity: 2
      words:
      - mark
      - note
      - stare
    - verity: 1
      words:
      - be apprised of
      - pay attention to
      - take notice
  - word: appreciate, comprehen
    type: verb
    synonyms:
    - verity: 3
      words:
      - catch
      - determine
      - discover
    - verity: 2
      words:
      - grasp
      - imagine
      - investigate
    - verity: 1
      words:
      - get the drift
      - get the hang of
      - make out</pre>

    <p>For words that should just redirect to other words, use a
    <code>target</code>:</p>
    <pre>
- text: saw
  target: see</pre>

    <p>To ensure a word does not exist in the thesaurus, define only the word:</p>
    <pre>
- text: Gryphon</pre>

    <p>
        Note that it's entirely reasonable (and recommended) to setup 2 entries
        for a word that should be capicalized:
    </p>

    <pre>
- text: Christ
  meanings:
  - word: Jesus Christ
    type: noun
    synonyms:
    - verity: 1
      words:
      - Emmanuel
      - Good Shepherd
      - Jesus
      - King of Kings
      - Lamb of God
      - Light of the World
      - lord
      - Lord of Lords
      - messiah
